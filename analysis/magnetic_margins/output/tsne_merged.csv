S-Hallervord-issue,,"Der Band von 1628 enthält im Vorwort und im ""LIBER SEXTUS - DE TELLURIS GLOBOMAGNOMAGNETE"" zahlreiche Unterstreichungen in roter Farbe. Einige dieser Unterstreichungen sind so hoch angesetzt, dass man auch eine Durchstreichung vermuten könnte.
Die Bände unterscheiden sich in der Montage der Zeichnungen und Diagramme. 1628 wurde am Ende ein Anhang eingerichtet, der die Bilder enthält. 1633 wurden diese Blätter im Inhalt mit eingebunden.
Auf der Seite 160 wurde nur die Seitenzahl mit Bleistift korrigiert. Das mag der selbe Bibliothekar gewesen sein wie beim 1630er - Band ?!?? Ist schwer zu erkennen, da diese Stelle etwas überbelichtet ist.
Die Seite 215 ist ohne handschriftliche Anmerkung. Diese liegt nur der Paginierung folgend ordnungshalber dabei.
Zum Beispiel der Anhanggestaltung. Die Graphiken sind auf Photopapier erstellt. Stammen also sicherlich nicht aus 1628, oder was meinen Sie?",,Yes,B

images 1-3 the extensive annotation in the front endleaves
images 4-5 the title page of the Gilbert and a closeup of the signature of the title page
images 6-8  the annotations to pages 11, 17, and 19, as examples of what is there.

Just to most directly answer your queries now, I can confirm there are no handwritten comments within our copy, despite this copy being interleaved with blank pages – presumably in anticipation of reader comment.
There are, however, present; some signatures on the title-page, as well as a number of hand emendations, and instances of hand underlining on certain pages.  All examples that have been identified have been photographed for you and included in the PDF document, in case these are of interest.
You will also see in the attached PDF an image of an article that was published in a newspaper, evidently from many years ago.  This press-cutting is laid loosely within our copy; I contacted our former Rare Book Librarian (he has recently retired) to check, and he does not believe that the press-cutting refers specifically to our copy of the book.

I have looked at the volume, and there is only one page on which there are manuscript annotations. On page 206, there is a diagram entitled: “Diagramma notuum in orbibus magneticis”. Two straight lines have been added to the diagram in leadpoint. One is very thick, and actually comprises several lines that don’t entirely overlap each other, which bisect the circles, going through points E, G, [unnamed point], and L, and continuing in a straight line through the four additional unnamed points to the other side of the circles. The other line is singular, and is perpendicular to the first one, bisecting the circles through eight unnamed points. I include two photos.","It is likely that this book was owned by Seth Ward (1617-1689), who was the Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, and one of the founder member of the Royal Society, before becoming Bishop of Salisbury in 1667.

","Unser Exmeplar 44 Phys. 2° findet sich auf Seite 1.000 im Bücherradkatalog und gehörte bereits im Oktober 1626 zur Büchersammlung von Herzog August (1579-1666). Dieser hat zwischen 1625 und 1627 seine bis dahin vorhandene Sammlung in einem Gesamtkatalog erfasst, der nach erster Beendigung 1627 als Zugangsbuch bis über Augusts Tod hinaus ergänzt und fortgeführt wurde. Ein genaueres Zugangsdatum ist nicht ermittelbar. Seit den 1640er Jahren befindet sich der Band vor Ort in Wolfenbüttel, nachdem Herzog August nach mehreren Jahren Wartezeit 1644 das Residenzschloss beziehen konnte.

In den ausgewerteten historischen Ausleihbüchern von 1664 bis 1806 konnte ich nur eine Entleihung des Bandes ermitteln.

Am 24. Februar 1676, also diese Woche Donnerstag vor genau 346 Jahren, wurde das Buch vom Küchenmeister und späteren Hochfürstlich Braunschweigisch-Lüneburgischen Haushofmeister Siegmund Georg Schöps (22.04.1632-17.04.1699) entliehen. Am gleichen Tag wurde ihm auch der folgende Band vorgelegt: https://opac.lbs-braunschweig.gbv.de/DB=2/XMLPRS=N/PPN?PPN=15103642X [Exemplar 8.2 Quod. (1)]

Es handelt sich um die ersten Entleihungen, die für Schöps belegbar sind. Bis 1696 hat er insgesamt zwölf Bände entliehen. Die Familie Schöps nutzte die herzogliche Bibliothek regelmäßig. Auch seine Ehefrau nimmt zwei Mal Einsicht in Handschriften (""gemalte Blumenbücher""). Der Sohn Rudolf Siegmund, Student in Helmstedt, entleiht innerhalb von zwei Jahren dreizehn Bände, das letzte nur wenige Wochen vor seinem Tod im Alter von 22 Jahren.",Yes,B
